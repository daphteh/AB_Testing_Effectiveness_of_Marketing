# Context
Our client was one of the largest Chinese companies belonging to the baby milk industry which experienced a major scandal in 2008. Although the company was not culpable, their reputation was nonetheless tarnished by the scandal. Our task was to assess whether their efforts to reassure their customers 7 years later was effective.

2. How much this backfires is influenced by how badly affected was the customer's community


#### Key Takeaway: Firms belonging to industries plagued by scandals (such as crypto currency) or that lack legitimacy should consider building stakeholder trust by focusing on their strengths rather than reassuring them and inadvertently reminding them of the potential risks of entering a transaction.
