# Context
Our client was the 3rd the largest Chinese companies belonging to an industry which experienced a major scandal in 2008. Although the company was not culpable, their reputation was nonetheless tarnished by the scandal. Our task was to assess whether their efforts to reassure their customers 7 years later was effective.  

# Findings & Practical Implications
1. Consumers were **13.8%** less likely to purchase products when exposed to the certification: Displaying ISO certifications with the intention to reassure customers can backfire due to the [self-promoter's paradox](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2635061).

2. How negatively consumers respond to exposure to the certification is influenced by their exposure to the scandal.

#### Key Takeaway: Firms belonging to industries plagued by scandals (such as crypto currency) or that lack legitimacy should consider building stakeholder trust by focusing on their strengths rather than reassuring them. This could inadvertently remind consumers of risks of entering a transaction.
