# Context
Our client was one of the largest Chinese companies belonging to the baby milk industry which experienced a major scandal in 2008. Although the company was not culpable, their reputation was nonetheless tarnished by the scandal. Our task was to assess whether their efforts to reassure their customers was effective.  

# Key Findings & Practical Implications
1. Displaying ISO certifications with the intention to reassure customers can backfire (self-promoter's paradox)
  >-    
2. How much this backfires is influenced by how badly affected was the customer's community
